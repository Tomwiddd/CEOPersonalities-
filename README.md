# CEOPersonalities-
Final Project
Make get_data.ipynb (or similar): Create and save a fake tiny toy dataset that looks like your final dataset (same key variables, maybe not all, but enough to make it work.) Eventually this will be the code your partners make. For now, you'll use this to prototype the dashboard.
Make data_description.ipynb (or similar): Load and produce basic info of the data (time range, # firms, # obs, descriptive stats). This will be useful to get info and make outputs for the presentation/website.
Make app.py: This file makes the website. Play around with ways to get your outputs to show and adding filters/features.
